## Analysis Development

## Draft Presentation
Using the presentation software of your choice (either Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote), draft a short, five to six minute presentation of your findings. Please refer to my resources on <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/presentingData/" target="_blank">presenting research</a> for guidance on constructing a good presentation. At the draft stage, you should already have identified a theme that you will use for your final presentation. The slides you submit should therefore be indictive of how your plan to visually design your final slides.

At the draft stage, presentations should include _as a minimum_:

1. A title slide (presentation title, name, date, etc.),
2. an agenda slide with the main topics you want to cover (see the "[Final Presentation](/final-presentation.html)" instructions for a full list of what should be included),
3. a literature slide 
    - SOC 4015 students should include the two or three key citations identified as part of the memo exercise
    - SOC 5050 students should avoid the temptation to summarize each of their sources; instead, synthesize the main points of the literature succinctly
4. a *draft* descriptive statistics table as described in the "[Initial Statistics](initial-statistics.html)",
5. and *draft* plots, including your histogram, q-q plot, and scatter plot described in the "[Exploratory Data Analysis](/exploratory-data-analysis.html)" section above.

Your draft will be graded using the "check" system outlined in the syllabus.

## Draft Handout
Using either a word processor (either Microsoft Word or Apple Pages), RMarkdown, or LaTeX, produce a handout that is clearly laid out and simple to follow. At the draft stage, you should have already identified the organizational strategy you will use for your handout. The handout you submit should therefore be indicitive of how you plan to lay out your handout. 

At the draft stage, presentations should include _as a minimum_:

1. A title block that contains your title slide information (presentation title, name, date, etc.),
2. an abstract that summarizes your research question and hypothesis,
3. a descriptive statistics table, and
4. a few key citations.

These four elements should fit on the front size of an 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper.

Your draft will be graded using the "check" system outlined in the syllabus.
