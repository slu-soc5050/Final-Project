# Basics {-}

```{block, type = "rmdwarning"}
These are the **draft** final project instructions for **Fall 2018**. Changes should expected before the release of the instructions prior to the first day of class. This will occur in mid August.
```

As described in the [syllabus](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus), the final project corresponds to the fourth course learning outcome:

> 4. Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using `R`), and present (using `knitr` as well as the word pressing and presentation applications of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.

All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050).

### How are these instructions organized? {-}
These instructions are organized into **vignettes** (pronouced `vin'yets`). These are meant to create "bite sized" modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions.

#### What do I have to do? {-}
Each vignette includes an indiactor that describes *what* the goal of the vignette is:

```{block, type = "rmdgoal"}
**Goal:** create a quick summary of your project for Chris.
```

The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 or SOC 5050. Look for this indiactor for information about *who* the vignette is designed for:

```{block, type = "rmdpersonnel"}
**Personnel:** This vignette should be completed by **all** students.
```

If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this:

```{block, type = "rmdpersonnel"}
**Personnel:** This vignette should be completed by students in **SOC 5050** only.
```

#### What order do I have to do the vignettes in? {-}
Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indiactor will include pertinent details about ordering:

```{block, type = "rmdpre"}
**Pre-requisties:** This vignette should be completed *after* **Vignette 6**.
```

Otherwise you will see this indicator:

```{block, type = "rmdpre"}
**Pre-requisties:** There are no pre-requisites for this vignette.
```

#### What do I need to know how to do? {-}
Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indiactor:

```{block, type = "rmdskills"}
**Skills:** Lectures 1 and 2
```

#### When are vignettes due? {-}
Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a *suggested* deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this:

```{block, type = "rmddue"}
**Required Due Date:** This vignette must be completed by March 15^th^.
```

Suggested deadlines will look like this:

```{block, type = "rmddue"}
***Suggested* Completion Date:** This vignette should be completed by March 15^th^.
```

#### What do I have to submit? {-}
All of the vignettes require you to produce *something*. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator:

```{block, type = "rmddeliver"}
**Deliverables:** A knit `.Rmd` notebook with the appropriate `.md` output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository.
```
