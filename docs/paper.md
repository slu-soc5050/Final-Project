## Analysis Development

Your draft paper should be saved in your `docs/` folder. You may find it makes sense to create a sub-folder for your presentation slides - something like `docs/paper/` - since the notebooks and their output will create quite a few files. Save both the editable source document in its native format as well as a `.pdf` rendering of the document. When you create your final paper, do note overwrite the draft. Make sure both are saved separately (as in `paper-draft.doc` and `paper-final.doc`).

As with the presentations, there are not strict requirements for what you write your paper in so long as it is in wide use in academia. Options include Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Google Docs, or LaTeX. Most students will find Word or Pages to be the easiest choices, but I can provide some support to students who want to try their hand at using LaTeX. As I mentioned in the "[Presentation Tools]" section, I recommending working with <a href="http://sharelatex.com" target="_blank">ShareLaTeX</a> if you want to give LaTeX a shot. This web-based tool would allow you to share your work with me in a way that I can easily provide help and feedback.

<div class="rmdwarning">
<p>It is imperative that a <code>.pdf</code> version is present for both your draft and final submissions. Since I do not have strict software requirements, I need to be sure that I can open your paper and it looks as you intended it to look!</p>

## Draft Paper
Begin creating a draft that will evolve into a journal article manuscript. The writing does not need to be polished but you should make at least one dedicated pass at editing before you submit your draft.

### Formatting

Your draft should be formatted as it would be for your final submission so that formatting can be a piece of the peer review process. This assignment follows the *<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/ajs/instruct" target="_blank">American Journal of Sociology</a>* formatting guidelines with the following exceptions/clarifications:

1. Your target length for this assignment is approximately 5,000 words all inclusive - citations, tables, and notes all count towards this total. You should be within 500 words of this target (i.e. between 4,500 and 5,500 words). Manuscripts should use 1" margins with 12 point, serif font.
2. The first page should be a cover page with a title, word count, key words, your name, your affiliation, and your contact information (professional address, email). Use the "Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Saint Louis University, 3700 Lindell Blvd., St. Louis MO 63108" if you need a professional address.
3. All in-text and works cited references should follow the American Sociological Association citation standards.

Please read the *<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/ajs/instruct" target="_blank">American Journal of Sociology</a>* guidelines for additional details. Learning to read these types of instructions for authors is an important academic skill!

### Contents

At the draft stage, papers should include _as a minimum_:

1. A cover page,
2. a *draft* abstract,
3. a *draft* body that includes:
    * Introduction
    * Background
    * Data and Methods
4. a *draft* works cited section,
5. any expository end-notes,
6. and at least one *draft* table and one *draft* figure.

All sections (and each table and figure) should begin on their own page. 

## Peer Review Instructions

<div class="rmdwarning">
<p>Expectations for the peer review element of the assignment are under development and will be posted after the beginning of the semester.</p>
</div>

## Final Paper

Your final paper should be formatted carefully based on the guidelines described in the "[Draft Paper]" section. Papers that do not follow the formatting criteria will not be graded, just as papers submitted to a journal without regard for their formatting standards will recieve a "desk rejection" and will not be sent out for review.

At the final submission stage, papers should include _as a minimum_:

1. A cover page,
2. an abstract not exceeding 100 words,
3. a body that includes:
    * Introduction
    * Background
    * Data and Methods
    * Results
    * Discussion (with Limitations subsection)
    * Conclusion
4. a works cited section,
5. expository end-notes,
6. tables,
7. and figures.

All sections (and each table and figure) should begin on their own page.
