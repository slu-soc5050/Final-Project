Changes should expected before the release of the instructions prior to the first day of class. This will occur in mid August. As described in the syllabus, the final project corresponds to the fourth course learning outcome: Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using R), and present (using knitr as well as the word pressing and presentation applications of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question. All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050). How are these instructions organized? These instructions are organized into vignettes (pronouced vin'yets). These are meant to create “bite sized” modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions. What do I have to do? Each vignette includes an indiactor that describes what the goal of the vignette is: Goal: create a quick summary of your project for Chris. The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 or SOC 5050. Look for this indiactor for information about who the vignette is designed for: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by all students. If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by students in SOC 5050 only. What order do I have to do the vignettes in? Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indiactor will include pertinent details about ordering: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be completed after Vignette 6. Otherwise you will see this indicator: Pre-requisties: There are no pre-requisites for this vignette. What do I need to know how to do? Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indiactor: Skills: Lectures 1 and 2 When are vignettes due? Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a suggested deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this: Required Due Date: This vignette must be completed by March 15th. Suggested deadlines will look like this: Suggested Completion Date: This vignette should be completed by March 15th. What do I have to submit? All of the vignettes require you to produce something. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator: Deliverables: A knit .Rmd notebook with the appropriate .md output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository.

Personnel: This vignette should be completed by all students. Make sure to follow the instructions for the section you are enrolled in (either SOC 4015 or SOC 5050). Pre-requisties: There are no pre-requisites for this vignette. Skills: There are no course-specific skills for this vignette. Required Due Date: Lecture 3 (September 10th) Deliverables: A short memo detailing your data, the variables you’ll be using, and the reasons you’ve selected them. "],
["data-for-soc-4015.html", "1.1 Data for SOC 4015", " 1.1 Data for SOC 4015 If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have a choice: The easier option is to follow the instructions in this section, which direct you to a pre-selected data set and provide you a list of possible outcomes to “study” for the final project. The more difficult option is to identify your own data set. If you want to pursue this option, see the instructions in the next section. 1.1.1 The General Social Survey The General Social Survey (GSS) is fielded by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which is based at the University of Chicago. It has been in continuous operation since 1972: The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years. The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events. You can read more about the GSS on NORC’s website. A data set containing the 2016 General Social Survey variables has been created and made available through GitHub. Since some questions are only asked in certain years, the data set that I am providing has been limited only to questions used in 2016. Keep this in mind as you look through the documentation! 1.1.2 Picking an Outcome There are at least 37 continuous variables (or combinations thereof) that make sense for use as outcomes for the final project. Pick two outcomes, a first choice and a second choice, from the list below. Every effort will be made to give you your first choice, but in the event that two or more of your colleagues also have the same first choice, I will randomly select the two students who may use that outcome variable. Possible outcome variables: hrs1 - respondent’s hours worked last week prestg10 - prestige of respondent’s occupation prestg105plus - prestige of respondent’s occupation, alternate formula sphrs1 - spouse’s hours worked last week sppres10 - prestige of spouse’s occupation sppres105plus - prestige of spouse’s occupation, alternate formula papres10 - prestige of father’s occupation papres105plus - prestige of father’s occupation, alternate formula mapres10 - prestige of mother’s occupation mapres105plus - prestige of mother’s occupation, alternate formula sibs - number of siblings hompop - number of people living in household babies - number of household members under 6 years of age preteen - number of household members between 6 and 12 years of age teens - number of household members between 13 and 17 years of age adults - number of household members over 17 years of age unrelat - number of household members not related earnrs - number of earners in the household sei10 - respondent’s socioeconomic index spsei10 - spouse’s socioeconomic index pasei10 - father’s socioeconomic index masei10 - mother’s socioeconomic index snsmyear - year first joined social network intwkdyh - internet use, weekday, hours and intwkdym - internet use, weekday, minutes intwkenh - internet use, weekend, hours and intwkenm - internet use, weekend, minutes racethwh - ten point scale for racial identity, white racethhi - ten point scale for racial identity, Latino racethbl - ten point scale for racial identity, black or African american racethas - ten point scale for racial identity, Asian racethna - ten point scale for racial identity, native american racethot - ten point scale for racial identity, other usualhrs - usual number of hours worked per week mosthrs - greatest number of hours worked per week in last month leasthrs - least number of hours worked per week in last month numwomen - number of female partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday nummen - number of male partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday agekdbrn - age at birth of first child There may be other variables in the GSS that can be used as well. The major requirements is that the variable is asked of a majority of respondents in 2016 and is continuous. If you find another variable that you think may work, check with Chris before proceeding. 1.1.3 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. Do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. For example, I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used. Be aware that Soc Abstracts will also return results from theses and other documents, so be sure to restrict your search and reading to peer reviewed journal articles. Qualitative studies can (and should!) also be used to inform variable selection, but since you are only being asked to find two relevant articles, we are going to prioritize quantitative research here. 1.1.4 Selecting Independent Variables Use the codebook included in the final project data release to see if variables similar to those you identified above are also in the GSS. Feel free to also use variables not mentioned in the articles, as long as you can make an argument that they are plausibly connected to the outcome. Your goal here is to create a theoretically motivated list of independent variables that are rooted in the literature. Once again, do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. If this were a more substantial project, you would want to look at far more articles than just two! We typically conduct full literature searches before selecting a group of variables to use in a particular analysis. "],
["data-for-soc-5050.html", "1.2 Data for SOC 5050", " 1.2 Data for SOC 5050 These instructions apply to two groups of students: You are enrolled in SOC 5050, or you are enrolled in SOC 4015 and want to pick your own data set rather than use the 2016 General Social Survey For both groups of students, these instructions will lay out the process for identifying an appropriate data set for your final project. 1.2.1 Characteristics of an Appropriate Data Set Data sets for your final project will have a number of salient characteristics: It should have a substantial sample size of at least several hundred respondents There should be a continuous variable that is a suitable outcome variable - i.e. something that we can estimate variation based on other variables in the data There should be at least six to eight possible constructs that can be used as independent variables - i.e. the variables that are used to estimate variation in our outcome 1.2.2 Other Considerations For those of you enrolled in SOC 5050, there are a few other considerations to take into account. If you have already identified a possible thesis topic, pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.2.3 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no codebook or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. The data should not be the 2016 General Social Survey. See Chris if you want to use another iteration of the GSS. If you are not sure where to start, the best option is to search through ICPSR - the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. SLU is an institutional member, so you will want to log in to ICPSR’s website by using this link and entering in your SLU login credentials. Once you are logged in, you can use the search tools to conduct keyword searches. 1.2.4 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. For example, if I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used.

["the-memo.html", "1.3 The Memo", " 1.3 The Memo Once you have completed all of the steps for identifying a suitable data set, outcome variable, and possible independent variables, you should create a new issue on your final project repository. In your issue: identify the data you are using, the outcome variable (and, if you are in SOC 4015, your second choice outcome as well), all of the independent variables you’ve selected, and a justification for each independent variable that addresses why it makes sense to include in your analysis. You will also need to provide properly formatted citations using the American Sociological Association citation style guide. Once you have your memo drafted, open the issue and assign it to Chris for review. "],

These should all be created by the first due date. Your documentation files should be completed by the second due date. "],
["data-storage.html", "2.1 Data Storage", " 2.1 Data Storage You will have a separate GitHub repository that is dedicated to the final project. This will facilitate some of the peer evaluation tasks you will be asked to complete over the course of the semester, allowing you to share a repository with a colleague without exposing all of your other work and grades in the process. All final project materials should be stored in this repository, and it should be organized following the project organization principles discussed in Sociospatial Data Science. This means that it should have subfolders for data/, docs/, results/, and source/ as well as a .Rproj file. If subfolders are empty, they will not be tracked by GitHub. If you are using only one computer, the folder will remain visible locally and Git will start tracking it once you begin adding materials. If you are using multiple computers, you can create empty text files named .gitkeep using RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) and keep one in each subfolder. Since you will be storing this repository on GitHub, you will be default be using version control for this project. You should make commits (like voting in Chicago!) early and often. Make sure that your commit messages are informative and clear. Remember, if you have to go back to an earlier version of your work, you will want to make it as easy as possible to do so. Also make sure that you are pushing to GitHub often and not just saving the work locally on your computer. This is part of your insurance against a catastrophic loss of your computer or a lab computer where you are working. You are strongly encouraged to use a more comprehesive backup solution, which you can lean more about in Sociospatial Data Science. "],
["project-planning.html", "2.2 Project Planning", " 2.2 Project Planning Use GitHub’s “Project Board” feature on your final project’s GitHub repository to plan out the tasks you need to complete. Create a new project and assign each vignette to a column. Then assign specific tasks and deliverables related to that vignette to individual notes in that column. As you progress through the project, keep this updated so that you can track your progress. You can read more about managing projects and tracking progress with a project board in GitHub’s documentation. "],
["project-documentation.html", "2.3 Project Documentation", " 2.3 Project Documentation There are two project-level documentation files that you will need to create and keep updated throughout the semester. 2.3.1 README.md You will need a read-me file in the top-level of your assignment repository. You can create it in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File). This file should describe the goal of the repository and, at a high level, how various elements of the project repository fit together. This file should be saved as a markdown file (.md) and should use markdown formatting appropriately. 2.3.2 RESEARCH_LOG.md You will need to maintain a research log throughout the final project process. Before proceeding with the vignettes, create a well-formatted and organized research log in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) that is organized chronologically. The research log should use markdown syntax and be saved as a markdown file (.md). Keep this file updated and have it saved in the top-level of your assignment repository. For each day you work on the final project, there should be an entry that describes the work that you have done, what files you have created or modified, and how those modifications took place. Give as much detail as possible without directly replicating the notes you make in individual files using the literate programming approach. Think of the research log as step-by-step instructions to yourself that would allow you to recreate all of your work should every final project file you work on be accidentally deleted or lost. For code, you can provide higher level details since, ideally, your literate programming approach means that your code is well annotated and described. For plots and your slides, you want to provide as much fine grained detail as possible down to specific font, color, and size choices for data and layout elements. "],

["what-is-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography?", " 3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography? An Annotated Bibliography is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic literature search of the peer reviewed literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley &amp; Sons). Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are many journals that publish sociological content, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (Social Science &amp; Medicine is a great example). Beaware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called “predatory” journals (along with fake conferences) that capitalize on the “publish or perish” culture of academia as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries.
