["crafting-a-research-question.html", "1.1 Crafting a Research Question", " 1.1 Crafting a Research Question The process of conducting a research project starts with defining a research question to explore. For many students, this can be daunting. Yale University Sociology’s Handbook for Undergraduate Thesis research usefully breaks down the types of questions sociologists answer into three broad categories. I’ve provided these three categories below along with some sample research questions on undocumented immigration: “Questions about the meaning of certain activities, practices, or experiences for particular social groups.” “How do classmates respond when a student discloses that they are an undocumented immigrant?” “How does participation in an immigrant advocacy group effect undocumented immigrants?” “How does disclosing undocumented status change the treatment of immigrants in social services settings?” “Questions about the ways that identification with larger social categories – race, ethnicity, religion, political identification, gender – affect aspects of social life.” “What is the relationship between political conservatism and beliefs about immigration?” “How do views of immigration vary based on gender identity?” “What is the relationship between religiosity and support for undocumented immigrants?” “Questions about the influence of particular variables on other variables or outcomes, including questions that compare groups and track trends across a broader scale.” “What is the relationship between levels of education and employment for undocumented immigrants?” “How does racial segregation impact the outcomes of undocumented immigrants in cities?” “What is the effect of DREAMer status on educational attainment?” Each student should think about the overarching category they want to conduct research in. If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have the option from picking from some pre-defined topics, so the broad category can be easily extracted from the list of variables found under “Data for SOC 4015”. If you opt to pick your own data instead (or have to, if you are in SOC 5050), you will want to start with a broad category like “illegal immigration” and then narrow down that to something that is narrow enough that you can address it with the data you have. This means that once you have a question, you want to seek out some data to help you address it. This process is covered in the next two sections, split based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 (see “Data for SOC 4015”) or SOC 5050 (see “Data for SOC 5050”). If you are enrolled in SOC 4015 want to pick your own data set, follow the instructions under “Data for SOC 4015.” Like the research process as a whole (see “Data Analysis is not Linear”), you may find that crafting a research question is an iterative process. You’ll start with a broad topic, make a first attempt at narrowing it down, and then subsequently update the question as you find some related sources (and, if you are in SOC 5050, conduct a full-fledged literature review).

["data-for-soc-4015.html", "1.2 Data for SOC 4015", " 1.2 Data for SOC 4015 If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have a choice: The easier option is to follow the instructions in this section, which direct you to a pre-selected data set and provide you a list of possible outcomes to “study” for the final project. The more difficult option is to identify your own data set. If you want to pursue this option, see the instructions in the next section. 1.2.1 The General Social Survey The General Social Survey (GSS) is fielded by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which is based at the University of Chicago. It has been in continuous operation since 1972: The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years. The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events. You can read more about the GSS on NORC’s website. A data set containing the 2016 General Social Survey variables has been created and made available through GitHub. Since some questions are only asked in certain years, the data set that I am providing has been limited only to questions used in 2016. Keep this in mind as you look through the documentation! 1.2.2 Picking an Outcome There are at least 37 continuous variables (or combinations thereof) that make sense for use as outcomes for the final project. Pick two outcomes, a first choice and a second choice, from the list below. Every effort will be made to give you your first choice, but in the event that two or more of your colleagues also have the same first choice, I will randomly select the two students who may use that outcome variable. Possible outcome variables: hrs1 - respondent’s hours worked last week prestg10 - prestige of respondent’s occupation prestg105plus - prestige of respondent’s occupation, alternate formula sphrs1 - spouse’s hours worked last week sppres10 - prestige of spouse’s occupation sppres105plus - prestige of spouse’s occupation, alternate formula papres10 - prestige of father’s occupation papres105plus - prestige of father’s occupation, alternate formula mapres10 - prestige of mother’s occupation mapres105plus - prestige of mother’s occupation, alternate formula sibs - number of siblings hompop - number of people living in household babies - number of household members under 6 years of age preteen - number of household members between 6 and 12 years of age teens - number of household members between 13 and 17 years of age adults - number of household members over 17 years of age unrelat - number of household members not related earnrs - number of earners in the household sei10 - respondent’s socioeconomic index spsei10 - spouse’s socioeconomic index pasei10 - father’s socioeconomic index masei10 - mother’s socioeconomic index snsmyear - year first joined social network intwkdyh - internet use, weekday, hours and intwkdym - internet use, weekday, minutes intwkenh - internet use, weekend, hours and intwkenm - internet use, weekend, minutes racethwh - ten point scale for racial identity, white racethhi - ten point scale for racial identity, Latino racethbl - ten point scale for racial identity, black or African american racethas - ten point scale for racial identity, Asian racethna - ten point scale for racial identity, native american racethot - ten point scale for racial identity, other usualhrs - usual number of hours worked per week mosthrs - greatest number of hours worked per week in last month leasthrs - least number of hours worked per week in last month numwomen - number of female partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday nummen - number of male partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday agekdbrn - age at birth of first child There may be other variables in the GSS that can be used as well. The major requirements is that the variable is asked of a majority of respondents in 2016 and is continuous. If you find another variable that you think may work, check with Chris before proceeding. 1.2.3 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. Do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. For example, I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used. Be aware that Soc Abstracts will also return results from theses and other documents, so be sure to restrict your search and reading to peer reviewed journal articles. Qualitative studies can (and should!) also be used to inform variable selection, but since you are only being asked to find two relevant articles, we are going to prioritize quantitative research here. 1.2.4 Selecting Independent Variables Use the code book included in the final project data release to see if variables similar to those you identified above are also in the GSS. Feel free to also use variables not mentioned in the articles, as long as you can make an argument that they are plausibly connected to the outcome. Your goal here is to create a theoretically motivated list of independent variables that are rooted in the literature. Once again, do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. If this were a more substantial project, you would want to look at far more articles than just two! We typically conduct full literature searches before selecting a group of variables to use in a particular analysis. "],
["data-for-soc-5050.html", "1.3 Data for SOC 5050", " 1.3 Data for SOC 5050 These instructions apply to two groups of students: You are enrolled in SOC 5050, or you are enrolled in SOC 4015 and want to pick your own data set rather than use the 2016 General Social Survey For both groups of students, these instructions will lay out the process for identifying an appropriate data set for your final project. 1.3.1 Characteristics of an Appropriate Data Set Data sets for your final project will have a number of salient characteristics: It should have a substantial sample size of at least several hundred respondents There should be a continuous variable that is a suitable outcome variable - i.e. something that we can estimate variation based on other variables in the data There should be at least six to eight possible constructs that can be used as independent variables - i.e. the variables that are used to estimate variation in our outcome 1.3.2 Other Considerations For those of you enrolled in SOC 5050, there are a few other considerations to take into account. If you have already identified a possible thesis topic, pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.3.3 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no code book or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. The data should not be the 2016 General Social Survey. See Chris if you want to use another iteration of the GSS. If your data are longitudinal, you will want to pick data from one time period. If you are not sure where to start, the best option is to search through ICPSR - the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. SLU is an institutional member, so you will want to log in to ICPSR’s website by using this link and entering in your SLU login credentials. Once you are logged in, you can use the search tools to conduct keyword searches. 1.3.4 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. For example, if I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used.

["the-memo.html", "1.4 The Memo", " 1.4 The Memo Once you have completed all of the steps for identifying a suitable data set, outcome variable, and possible independent variables, you should create a new issue on your final project repository. In your issue: State what your research question is, identify the data you are using to address that question, the outcome variable (and, if you are in SOC 4015 and using the 2016 GSS, your second choice outcome as well), all of the independent variables you’ve selected, and a justification for each independent variable that addresses why it makes sense to include in your analysis. You will also need to provide properly formatted citations using the American Sociological Association citation style guide. Once you have your memo drafted, open the issue and assign it to Chris for review. "]
