Changes should expected before the release of the instructions prior to the first day of class. This will occur in mid August. As described in the syllabus, the final project corresponds to the fourth course learning outcome: Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using R), and present (using knitr as well as the word pressing and presentation applications of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question. All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050). How are these instructions organized? These instructions are organized into vignettes (pronouced vin'yets). These are meant to create “bite sized” modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions. What do I have to do? Each vignette includes an indiactor that describes what the goal of the vignette is: Goal: create a quick summary of your project for Chris. The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 or SOC 5050. Look for this indiactor for information about who the vignette is designed for: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by all students. If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by students in SOC 5050 only. What order do I have to do the vignettes in? Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indiactor will include pertinent details about ordering: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be completed after Vignette 6. Otherwise you will see this indicator: Pre-requisties: There are no pre-requisites for this vignette. What do I need to know how to do? Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indiactor: Skills: Lectures 1 and 2 When are vignettes due? Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a suggested deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this: Required Due Date: This vignette must be completed by March 15th. Suggested deadlines will look like this: Suggested Completion Date: This vignette should be completed by March 15th. What do I have to submit? All of the vignettes require you to produce something. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator: Deliverables: A knit .Rmd notebook with the appropriate .md output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository.
