At the draft stage, presentations should include as a minimum: A title slide (presentation title, name, date, etc.), an agenda slide with the main topics you want to cover (see the “Final Presentation” instructions for a full list of what should be included), a literature slide SOC 4015 students should include the two or three key citations identified as part of the memo exercise SOC 5050 students should avoid the temptation to summarize each of their sources; instead, synthesize the main points of the literature succinctly a draft descriptive statistics table as described in the “Initial Statistics”, and draft plots, including your histogram, q-q plot, and scatter plot described in the “Exploratory Data Analysis” section above.
