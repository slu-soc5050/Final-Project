All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050). How are these instructions organized? These instructions are organized into vignettes (pronounced vin'yets). These are meant to create “bite sized” modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions. What do I have to do? Each vignette includes an indicator that describes what the goal of the vignette is: Goal: create a quick summary of your project for Chris. The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 or SOC 5050. Look for this indicator for information about who the vignette is designed for: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by all students. If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this: Personnel: This vignette should be completed by students in SOC 5050 only. What order do I have to do the vignettes in? Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indicator will include pertinent details about ordering: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be completed after Vignette 6. Otherwise you will see this indicator: Pre-requisties: There are no pre-requisites for this vignette. What do I need to know how to do? Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indicator: Skills: Lectures 1 and 2 When are vignettes due? Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a suggested deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this: Required Due Date: This vignette must be completed by March 15th. Suggested deadlines will look like this: Suggested Completion Date: This vignette should be completed by March 15th. What do I have to submit? All of the vignettes require you to produce something. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator: Deliverables: A knit .Rmd notebook with the appropriate .md output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository. Data Analysis is not Linear The organization of these instructions implies a linear path - complete one vignette and then go on to the next. You’ll notice that the pre-requisite vignette box for most vignettes look something like this: Pre-requisties: This vignette should be started after Vignette 5’s initial completion. This wording is meant to remind you that data analysis is never a linear process. You are going to have to iterate over vignettes, often several times. You’ll perhaps do some initial data cleaning, calculate descriptive statistics, and notice that the frequency of a particular category is too small. So you’ll have to go back, re-code that particular variable, and recalculate your descriptive statistics. This process of iteration is the norm for statistical analysis. Even the most experienced statisticians do this - it is not a function of inexperience so much as it is the nature of doing analytic work. One of the reasons that a plain-text approach to programming and statistics is so powerful is that this iteration becomes easy. You won’t have to remember the series of menu selections and check boxes you chose to produce a particular output as you would with a GUI-driven statistical application. Rather, recalculating descriptive statistics is as easy as making a small change to the source code for the data cleaning notebook, knitting that notebook, and then re-knitting the descriptive statistics notebook. Working in this way gives you the freedom to explore and experiment as much as you’d like! "],

["crafting-a-research-question.html", "1.1 Crafting a Research Question", " 1.1 Crafting a Research Question The process of conducting a research project starts with defining a research question to explore. For many students, this can be daunting. Yale University Sociology’s Handbook for Undergraduate Thesis research usefully breaks down the types of questions sociologists answer into three broad categories. I’ve provided these three categories below along with some sample research questions on undocumented immigration: “Questions about the meaning of certain activities, practices, or experiences for particular social groups.” “How do classmates respond when a student discloses that they are an undocumented immigrant?” “How does participation in an immigrant advocacy group effect undocumented immigrants?” “How does disclosing undocumented status change the treatment of immigrants in social services settings?” “Questions about the ways that identification with larger social categories – race, ethnicity, religion, political identification, gender – affect aspects of social life.” “What is the relationship between political conservatism and beliefs about immigration?” “How do views of immigration vary based on gender identity?” “What is the relationship between religiosity and support for undocumented immigrants?” “Questions about the influence of particular variables on other variables or outcomes, including questions that compare groups and track trends across a broader scale.” “What is the relationship between levels of education and employment for undocumented immigrants?” “How does racial segregation impact the outcomes of undocumented immigrants in cities?” “What is the effect of DREAMer status on educational attainment?” Each student should think about the overarching category they want to conduct research in. If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have the option from picking from some pre-defined topics, so the broad category can be easily extracted from the list of variables found under “Data for SOC 4015”. If you opt to pick your own data instead (or have to, if you are in SOC 5050), you will want to start with a broad category like “illegal immigration” and then narrow down that to something that is narrow enough that you can address it with the data you have. This means that once you have a question, you want to seek out some data to help you address it. This process is covered in the next two sections, split based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 (see “Data for SOC 4015”) or SOC 5050 (see “Data for SOC 5050”). If you are enrolled in SOC 4015 want to pick your own data set, follow the instructions under “Data for SOC 4015.” Like the research process as a whole (see “Data Analysis is not Linear”), you may find that crafting a research question is an iterative process. You’ll start with a broad topic, make a first attempt at narrowing it down, and then subsequently update the question as you find some related sources (and, if you are in SOC 5050, conduct a full-fledged literature review). "],
["data-for-soc-4015.html", "1.2 Data for SOC 4015", " 1.2 Data for SOC 4015 If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have a choice: The easier option is to follow the instructions in this section, which direct you to a pre-selected data set and provide you a list of possible outcomes to “study” for the final project. The more difficult option is to identify your own data set. If you want to pursue this option, see the instructions in the next section. 1.2.1 The General Social Survey The General Social Survey (GSS) is fielded by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which is based at the University of Chicago. It has been in continuous operation since 1972: The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years. The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events. You can read more about the GSS on NORC’s website. A data set containing the 2016 General Social Survey variables has been created and made available through GitHub. Since some questions are only asked in certain years, the data set that I am providing has been limited only to questions used in 2016. Keep this in mind as you look through the documentation! 1.2.2 Picking an Outcome There are at least 37 continuous variables (or combinations thereof) that make sense for use as outcomes for the final project. Pick two outcomes, a first choice and a second choice, from the list below. Every effort will be made to give you your first choice, but in the event that two or more of your colleagues also have the same first choice, I will randomly select the two students who may use that outcome variable. Possible outcome variables: hrs1 - respondent’s hours worked last week prestg10 - prestige of respondent’s occupation prestg105plus - prestige of respondent’s occupation, alternate formula sphrs1 - spouse’s hours worked last week sppres10 - prestige of spouse’s occupation sppres105plus - prestige of spouse’s occupation, alternate formula papres10 - prestige of father’s occupation papres105plus - prestige of father’s occupation, alternate formula mapres10 - prestige of mother’s occupation mapres105plus - prestige of mother’s occupation, alternate formula sibs - number of siblings hompop - number of people living in household babies - number of household members under 6 years of age preteen - number of household members between 6 and 12 years of age teens - number of household members between 13 and 17 years of age adults - number of household members over 17 years of age unrelat - number of household members not related earnrs - number of earners in the household sei10 - respondent’s socioeconomic index spsei10 - spouse’s socioeconomic index pasei10 - father’s socioeconomic index masei10 - mother’s socioeconomic index snsmyear - year first joined social network intwkdyh - internet use, weekday, hours and intwkdym - internet use, weekday, minutes intwkenh - internet use, weekend, hours and intwkenm - internet use, weekend, minutes racethwh - ten point scale for racial identity, white racethhi - ten point scale for racial identity, Latino racethbl - ten point scale for racial identity, black or African american racethas - ten point scale for racial identity, Asian racethna - ten point scale for racial identity, native american racethot - ten point scale for racial identity, other usualhrs - usual number of hours worked per week mosthrs - greatest number of hours worked per week in last month leasthrs - least number of hours worked per week in last month numwomen - number of female partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday nummen - number of male partners respondent has had sex with since their 18th birthday agekdbrn - age at birth of first child There may be other variables in the GSS that can be used as well. The major requirements is that the variable is asked of a majority of respondents in 2016 and is continuous. If you find another variable that you think may work, check with Chris before proceeding. 1.2.3 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. Do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. For example, I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used. Be aware that Soc Abstracts will also return results from theses and other documents, so be sure to restrict your search and reading to peer reviewed journal articles. Qualitative studies can (and should!) also be used to inform variable selection, but since you are only being asked to find two relevant articles, we are going to prioritize quantitative research here. 1.2.4 Selecting Independent Variables Use the code book included in the final project data release to see if variables similar to those you identified above are also in the GSS. Feel free to also use variables not mentioned in the articles, as long as you can make an argument that they are plausibly connected to the outcome. Your goal here is to create a theoretically motivated list of independent variables that are rooted in the literature. Once again, do this only for the first choice variable you’ve selected. If this were a more substantial project, you would want to look at far more articles than just two! We typically conduct full literature searches before selecting a group of variables to use in a particular analysis. "],
["data-for-soc-5050.html", "1.3 Data for SOC 5050", " 1.3 Data for SOC 5050 These instructions apply to two groups of students: You are enrolled in SOC 5050, or you are enrolled in SOC 4015 and want to pick your own data set rather than use the 2016 General Social Survey For both groups of students, these instructions will lay out the process for identifying an appropriate data set for your final project. 1.3.1 Characteristics of an Appropriate Data Set Data sets for your final project will have a number of salient characteristics: It should have a substantial sample size of at least several hundred respondents There should be a continuous variable that is a suitable outcome variable - i.e. something that we can estimate variation based on other variables in the data There should be at least six to eight possible constructs that can be used as independent variables - i.e. the variables that are used to estimate variation in our outcome 1.3.2 Other Considerations For those of you enrolled in SOC 5050, there are a few other considerations to take into account. If you have already identified a possible thesis topic, pick a data set that is either a possible candidate for inclusion in your thesis or, at the very least, is conceptually related. You want to maximize the impact that your coursework has, so even if you are not sure whether or not the data set itself will be helpful, picking something in the same topic area will mean that your literature search can be put to use on future assignments (such as in your Research Methods course). 1.3.3 Finding an Appropriate Data Set In general, you are free to use any resource to identify a suitable data set that meets the above criteria with a couple of caveats: There is not time for you to collect your own data. There is not time for you to go through the IRB process to gain access to confidential data (either data that is not publicly available or data collected by a thesis adviser or other faculty member). The data you use should be licensed for re-use (it cannot be proprietary or otherwise restrictively licensed). The data should be well documented - you want to be very sure what each variable represents. If there is no code book or documentation, the data set is probably not appropriate for this project. See Chris if you have questions about this. The data should not be the 2016 General Social Survey. See Chris if you want to use another iteration of the GSS. If your data are longitudinal, you will want to pick data from one time period. If you are not sure where to start, the best option is to search through ICPSR - the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. SLU is an institutional member, so you will want to log in to ICPSR’s website by using this link and entering in your SLU login credentials. Once you are logged in, you can use the search tools to conduct keyword searches. 1.3.4 A Quick Literature Search Once you have an outcome identified, go to Sociological Abstracts, enter your SLU login credentials, and conduct a keyword search using the main construct represented by your selected outcome variable. For example, if I picked a hypothetical variable sushi, representing the number of times the respondent had eaten sushi in the last year, I might use “sushi” or “Japanese food” as search terms. Look for two recent peer reviewed articles (i.e. in the last twenty or so years) that assess this same outcome quantitatively (i.e. using statistics), read the articles, and take note of the independent variables used.

In your issue: State what your research question is, identify the data you are using to address that question, the outcome variable (and, if you are in SOC 4015 and using the 2016 GSS, your second choice outcome as well), all of the independent variables you’ve selected, and a justification for each independent variable that addresses why it makes sense to include in your analysis.

This will facilitate some of the peer evaluation tasks you will be asked to complete over the course of the semester, allowing you to share a repository with a colleague without exposing all of your other work and grades in the process. All final project materials should be stored in this repository, and it should be organized following the project organization principles discussed in Sociospatial Data Science. This means that it should have subfolders for data/, docs/, results/, and source/ as well as a .Rproj file. If subfolders are empty, they will not be tracked by GitHub. If you are using only one computer, the folder will remain visible locally and Git will start tracking it once you begin adding materials. If you are using multiple computers, you can create empty text files named .gitkeep using RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) and keep one in each subfolder. Since you will be storing this repository on GitHub, you will be default be using version control for this project. You should make commits (like voting in Chicago!) early and often. Make sure that your commit messages are informative and clear. Remember, if you have to go back to an earlier version of your work, you will want to make it as easy as possible to do so. Also make sure that you are pushing to GitHub often and not just saving the work locally on your computer. This is part of your insurance against a catastrophic loss of your computer or a lab computer where you are working. You are strongly encouraged to use a more comprehesive backup solution, which you can lean more about in Sociospatial Data Science. "],

You can create it in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File). This file should describe the goal of the repository and, at a high level, how various elements of the project repository fit together. This file should be saved as a markdown file (.md) and should use markdown formatting appropriately. 2.3.2 RESEARCH_LOG.md You will need to maintain a research log throughout the final project process. Before proceeding with the vignettes, create a well-formatted and organized research log in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; Text File) that is organized chronologically. The research log should use markdown syntax and be saved as a markdown file (.md). Keep this file updated and have it saved in the top-level of your assignment repository. For each day you work on the final project, there should be an entry that describes the work that you have done, what files you have created or modified, and how those modifications took place. Give as much detail as possible without directly replicating the notes you make in individual files using the literate programming approach. Think of the research log as step-by-step instructions to yourself that would allow you to recreate all of your work should every final project file you work on be accidentally deleted or lost. For code, you can provide higher level details since, ideally, your literate programming approach means that your code is well annotated and described. For plots and your slides, you want to provide as much fine grained detail as possible down to specific font, color, and size choices for data and layout elements. "],

["what-is-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography?", " 3.1 What is an Annotated Bibliography? An Annotated Bibliography is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic literature search of the peer reviewed literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley &amp; Sons). Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are many journals that publish sociological content, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (Social Science &amp; Medicine is a great example). Beaware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called “predatory” journals (along with fake conferences) that capitalize on the “publish or perish” culture of academia as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries. While there are some lists of “predatory” journals, learning how to evaluate all articles critically is perhaps the best way to protect yourself against citing poor research. "],
["conducting-the-literature-search.html", "3.2 Conducting the Literature Search", " 3.2 Conducting the Literature Search 3.2.1 Analysis Development With your research question in-hand (see “Crafting a Research Question”), you will want to follow a semi-structured process for identifying appropriate peer reviewed sources. Document the places you search and the search terms / key words you use in your research log. As you find sources, I recommend keeping track of them in a spreadsheet. This makes it easier to figure out if you have already found and downloaded an article that you may come across multiple times. Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega website has a great example of a spreadsheet used for tracking literature. In one sheet of a spreadsheet workbook, keep track of the sources you’ve found, scanned (see “Evaluating Sources”), and found not to be useful. This is to serve as a reference later if you come across an article again and cannot remember if you already looked at it or not. You can easily generate bibliographic citations in Google Scholar by searching for the source and clicking the double quote icon under its Google Scholar entry (highlighted in red): Clicking that icon should open a pop-up window that includes pre-formatted references in a number of different styles: I tend to use Chicago, which requires minimal editing for both books and articles to convert the citation to ASA (see “Writing an Annotated Bibliography” for an explanation about why ASA is used). For books, you’ll want to move the year so that is referenced after the author’s name and add the city and state before the publisher’s name. For articles, you’ll want to move the year and simplify the volume and issue numbers. For sources that you find useful, enter them into a second sheet that includes a citation as well as how you found the article, what the major themes are, any notes you think you need on high-level details about the paper, and cross-references that indicate if the paper is cited by other papers you’ve found. These cross-references are important for making linkages between different aspects of the literature. 3.2.2 Process I strongly encourage students to follow this general process for identifying appropriate literature: Identify appropriate search terms: Based on your research question, what are the keywords that might help you find relevant articles? Identify the “state of the art”: Start by searching Annual Review journals (or similar, such as Sociology Compass) for recent articles that summarize the state of the literature in your area. You may not find an exact match, but you may find reviews of related topics. Use these articles to get a sense of what the “state of the art” is for your topic area(s). Citations from review articles: Use the review articles you find to identify both seminal publications that define a field of study (may not be recent) as well as more recent empirical studies. Find and download these articles. Search other social science publications: Whether or not you find helpful review articles, you will want to also search other key journals. Start with generalist journals and then move to more specific journals focused on particular types of research. Use the same search terms described above. In sociology, for example, the major generalist journals are American Sociological Review, American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, and Social Problems. In one of my sub-fields, medical sociology, Social Science and Medicine, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, and Health and Place are all key journals. Search related journals: Are there journals from other disciplines that are related? If so, search those as well using your search terms. In my research, the American Journal of Public Health and the Annals of the American Association of Geographers are both important journals from related disciplines. Search Sociological Abstracts: If you are not finding many citations, you may want to search the Sociological Abstracts database, which catalogs many more sociological journals. Iterative Processing of Articles: As you read through the articles you find and download in steps 3 through 7, seek out the studies that they cite that seem related. Download them, read them, and identify more related studies that they cite, then start the process over. Also use this process to identify books. Google Scholar can be instrumental in providing listings of articles that cite a given source. If you are coming from outside sociology and working on a project that is rooted in your home discipline, you will have to alter the above process to match the key Annual Review journal or journals as well as the other major publication outlets in your field.

["evaluating-sources.html", "3.3 Evaluating Sources", " 3.3 Evaluating Sources First, make sure what you’ve found is peer reviewed. If you’ve found a report or a popular press article (something like Time Magazine), hang onto it if you think it provides helpful contextual background but it should not be part of your literature search. If you’ve identified a dissertation or a thesis that seems helpful, there are typically two things worth doing: (1) check to see if it has been published as an article or a book (sometimes you’ll have to check out the author’s CV if you can find it), and (2) use it to identify other peer reviewed materials. Science Magazine has a great article that describes how different academics read articles. If you look through their responses, you’ll notice that few take a new article, read the abstract than read through the article cover to cover. Instead there are a variety of approaches to finding out the “meat” of the article quickly, without reading it in its entirety. Use this as a strategy for figuring out whether or not an article is a good fit for your project. Read the abstract, introduction, and discussion/conclusion sections to get a sense of the paper. Ask yourself if it makes a contribution to what you are researching. If it does, add it to your spreadsheet and fill out the necessary details. If it does not, add it to the “discard” list so you can find it later if you change your mind (or if you forget whether you’ve read it or not!). You can find some more details on the “AIC” technique for reading on Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s website. He also has a reading strategies. If the article does fit into your research, take some basic synthetic notes about the article. These will form the basis of your paragraphs for each source in the annotated bibliography. "],
["writing-an-annotated-bibliography.html", "3.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography", " 3.4 Writing an Annotated Bibliography The annotated bibilography itself is a document that lists your sources in alphabetical order (or alphabetized within groupings for specific categories). Begin each entry with a full, properly formatted citation using the American Sociological Association (ASA) citation style. I often get questions about whether students can use alternate citation formats. Different journals use different formats, so it is not possible for academics to learn and become comfortable with just one citation style. Rather, we use multiple citation styles regularly. Often, an article manuscript will be written in a specific citation style for one journal only to have to be reformatted in a different style for another journal if it is rejected on the first submission. Learning new citation styles quickly is therefore an important lesson, and one reason why ASA is the only citation style I accept for this project. After the citation style, there should be one to two paragraphs summarizing the article and its importance for your project. The strongest annotated bibliographies will draw substantive or thematic connections betwene sources, noting which articles are cited by others and which articles share important connections. This will help you develop the synthesis your literature review section for the paper requires. For more, see Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega’s post on writing an annotated bibliography. "],

All missing data have been recoded to NA values (if they were not already coded that way) - you will need to refer to your data set’s code book to determine how missing data are handled and in which variables they may be a concern. Categorical variables that have numerous categories should be checked carefully for categories that have only a few observations, and those should (generally speaking) be folded into an other category. All categorical variables should be stored in two ways: as a single categorical variable and as a series of “dummy” logical variables. Imagine a categorical measure for race that has three categories: (1) white, (2) black, and (3) asian. Your final cleaned data should contain this variable as well as a variable named white that is TRUE if the responded is white and FALSE if they are not. Your data should have similar logical variables for black and asian as well. These measures become relevant when we start calculating difference of means and regression lines. If your data set does not include identification numbers for each row, you will need to create them to facilitate assumption checks to your regression models. "],

Your final results for your presentation (and paper if applicable) should be stored in the results/ folder. 5.1.2 Initial Analyses As with other parts of the final project, this section will require some iteration. Initially, you should use the skimr package to calculate descriptive statistics for all of your study variables after you have done some initial data cleaning. The skimr results are best used for initial data exploration but should not be your only approach. Make sure to use other packages, like moments, to calculate additional descriptive statistics as needed for continuous variables. Use these initial calculations to make decisions about additional data cleaning and variable selection. During this initial phase, you should also use naniar to produce an analysis of missing data in your data set. Your final presentation (and paper if applicable) will need to describe any patterns of missing data and their possible impact on your results. 5.1.3 Final Analyses Once you have a finalized set of study variables, your presentation (and paper if applicable) should include a descriptive statistics for all of the final variables used in your project. Since all of these variables will be either logical, ordinal, or continuous, you need only report the means for each of these variables as well as the standard deviations and range. The meaning of TRUE and FALSE for logical variables should also be clearly articulated. If a particular categorical variable is important to your analysis, you could also report the frequencies and percentages for this variable in a separate table. Check out recent articles in the American Journal of Sociology for examples of different ways to present descriptive statistics. "],

Initially, you should use ggplot2 to produce some draft plots that explore the distribution of your dependent variable (using a histogram) and independent variables (using a combination of histograms and bar plots of the original categorical variables and not their recoded dummies). You should also produce bi-variate plots that show the relationship between your independent and dependent variables (using violin, ridge, and/or box and whisker plots as well as scatter plots). Finally, continuous variables should also be inspected for their normality using the appropriate visual techniques (including q-q plots). Use these initial plots to make decisions about additional data cleaning and variable selection, and to develop some initial thoughts about the relationships between your variables. 6.1.3 Final Plotting Once you have a finalized set of study variables, produce final versions of plots using ggplot2 and, if you would like, ggridges and ggstatsplot. All presentations and papers should contain a histogram and q-q plot of your dependent variable. You should also include plots showing the bi-variate relationship between your dependent variable and the main independent variable of interest.

The first should be your “main effect” model with your dependent variable regressed on your main independent variable (or variables if the it is a categorical concept represented by dummy variables). The second (and optionally third) should add your other independent variables.

Since I do not have strict software requirements, I need to be sure that I can open your slides and handout, and that each looks as you intended it! 9.1.1 Presentation Tools There are no strict guidelines other than you should use a presentation tool common in academia. This includes Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, or LaTeX Beamer. LaTeX is a professional typesetting tool that is widely used in academia for publishing, and it can make work like writing a graduate thesis significantly easier. If you are interesting in using this as an opportunity to learn LaTeX, I have some resources I can share. I also recommending working with ShareLaTeX, which would allow you to share your work with me in a way that I can easily provide help and feedback. If you are interested in using R and RStudio for creating your slides, there are a number of options: ioslides slidy xaringan Of these, I think that xaringan is the best (though it is also the least documented). You can see what its output looks like on Yihui Xie’s website. More details about ioslides and slidy can be found in Yihui’s book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide. I use xaringan for some tasks, but presentations are one area where I do not privilege plain-text documents - I teach and present research most often with Apple’s Keynote. As I said above, there are no strict requirements for presentation software other than that it be in wide use in academia. If a tool is not discussed in this section, please check with me before starting to build your presentation with it. The only tool that I do not allow students to use is Presi. Please choose the tool you feel either most comfortable with or that you see as a long term investment in skill building. 9.1.2 Handout Tools As with presentation tools, I am not particularly concerned with the tool that you use to create your handout so long as it is in wide use in academia. Options include Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Google Docs, Adobe InDesign, LaTeX, or even RMarkdown.

For the literature and data, do not just summarize each but rather make a case for your study: what is the gap in the literature you are addressing? Why is the study design best suited to address that gap? You do not necessarily have to be this explicit on the slide itself, but should be when you describe the slide on presentation day. When you conclude, go back to this gap and make a case for how you’ve addressed it. We call this the “so what” part of a presentation - make sure your audiance does not leave wondering “so what”!1 This is, generally speaking, the way that professional conference presentations should be structured. There are only two major differences - we typically have a bit longer for conferences, which often offer presenters ten to fifteen minutes, and presenting data on the normality of your dependent variable is typically not a part of what you would present.

I will have two Apple adapters available but cannot guarantee that they will work with all Mac laptops. If needed, however, Mac users can present using my laptop. I will also provide a clicker for those students who are interested in using it. One word of caution - a presentation in front of others is usually not the best time to try using a clicker for the first time. You should practice using one ahead of time, and can borrow one to do so from Ashlee Dorsey, the Sociology and Anthropology Department Administrator. Make sure you are prepared to speak clearly and loudly. Some students may find notes helpful, but I strongly encourage you not to read verbatim from them. If you are going to bring notes, here are a few tips:2 write your notes like you’d say them (short, declarative sentences) plan to speak at about 100-150 words per minute print it 14pt font or bigger Practicing in front of a mirror or in front of roommates, friends, or family can be very helpful. Being able to practice means being done with sufficient time to make that practice happen - build this into your planning from the outset!

The writing does not need to be polished but you should make at least one dedicated pass at editing before you submit your draft. 10.2.1 Formatting Your draft should be formatted as it would be for your final submission so that formatting can be a piece of the peer review process. This assignment follows the American Journal of Sociology formatting guidelines with the following exceptions/clarifications: Your target length for this assignment is approximately 5,000 words all inclusive - citations, tables, and notes all count towards this total. You should be within 500 words of this target (i.e. between 4,500 and 5,500 words). Manuscripts should use 1&quot; margins with 12 point, serif font. The first page should be a cover page with a title, word count, 3 to 5 key words, your name, your affiliation, and your contact information (professional address, email). Use the “Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Saint Louis University, 3700 Lindell Blvd., St. Louis MO 63108” if you need a professional address. All in-text and works cited references should follow the American Sociological Association citation standards. See my discussion under “[General Structure of Annotated Bibliography]” for details on why ASA is the only accepted format. Please read the American Journal of Sociology guidelines for additional details and requirements. Like citation styles, journals are often idiosyncratic in their formatting guidelines. Each journal is a little bit different from the next and requires different things in its instructions to authors. There is therefore not just one way to submit an article. This project is structured to walk you through some of the mechanics of authoring an article manuscript, which includes formatting an article in an often foreign and exacting manner. There are critiques to journals operating this way, and I think many of them are valid. Nevertheless, these standards remain and becoming fluent in conforming to them is a skill that graduate students must acquire. 10.2.2 Contents At the draft stage, papers should include as a minimum: A cover page, a draft abstract, a draft body that includes: Introduction Background Data and Methods a draft works cited section, any expository end-notes, and at least one draft table and one draft figure. All numbered sections (and each table and figure) should begin on their own page. The Background, Data and Methods, and other paper sections should not begin on their own page. Some students do not like to write the introduction first, preferring to write the rest of the paper and then return to the intro. I think it is important to at least draft an introduction first that gives you a strong starting place. Think of this as building a foundation for the rest of the paper. Here are some tips from Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega. The Background section should contain your literature review. Remember that you need to draw your literature together and provide analysis - you should absolutely not summarize one article, then summarize another, and so on. This takes practice, and Dr. Pacheco-Vega also provides some tips for distinguishing between description and analysis in academic writing. Dr. Pacheco-Vega also has a great post on converting your annotated bibliography into a literature review. The Data and Methods section should contain greater detail than a typical journal article manuscript. Please be sure to reference and cite all packages that you use, and to describe extensively the process you followed cleaning and analyzing your data. Be sure to dedicate space in this section to describing the distribution of your dependent variable. "],
