## Data for SOC 4015
If you are enrolled in SOC 4015, you have a choice:

1. The **easier** option is to follow the instructions in this section, which direct you to a pre-selected data set and provide you a list of possible outcomes to "study" for the final project. 
2. The **more difficult** option is to identify your own data set. If you want to pursue this option, see the instructions in the [next section](/data-for-soc-5050.html).

### The General Social Survey
The General Social Survey (GSS) is fielded by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), which is based at the University of Chicago. It has been in continuous operation since 1972:

> The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.  Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

> The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

You can read more about the GSS on [NORC's website](http://gss.norc.org).

### The 2016 GSS
A data set containing the 2016 General Social Survey variables has been created and made available [through GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/final-project-data). There are a total of 33 continuous variables that make sense for use as outcomes for the final project. Pick two outcomes, a first choice and a second choice, from the list below. 

Every effort will be made to give you your first choice, but in the event that two or more of your colleagues also have the same first choice, I will randomly select the two students who may use that outcome variable.
