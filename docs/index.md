# Basics {-}

<div class="rmdwarning">
<p>These are the <strong>draft</strong> final project instructions for <strong>Fall 2018</strong>. Changes should expected before the release of the instructions prior to the first day of class. This will occur in mid August.</p>
</div>

As described in the [syllabus](https://slu-soc5050.github.io/syllabus), the final project corresponds to the fourth course learning outcome:

> 4. Quantitative research synthesis: Plan, implement (using `R`), and present (using `knitr` as well as the word pressing and presentation applications of your choice) a research project that uses linear regression to answer a research question.

All students will select a set of variables from a data set and perform an original data analysis culminating in a series of linear regression models. Each student will be responsible for selecting a research question, establishing a hypothesis, conducting an analysis to test that hypothesis, and presenting the results. This process and project mirrors the steps taken to author a quantitative conference presentation (for all students) and a quantitative journal article (for students enrolled in SOC 5050).

### How are these instructions organized? {-}
These instructions are organized into **vignettes** (pronouced `vin'yets`). These are meant to create "bite sized" modules that break down the final project into discrete phases. Each vignette has a set of indicators on the top-level page for the vignette that provide you with some general information about what the vignette entails. These indicators will help you quickly navigate the instructions.

#### What do I have to do? {-}
Each vignette includes an indiactor that describes *what* the goal of the vignette is:

<div class="rmdgoal">
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> create a quick summary of your project for Chris.</p>
</div>

The instructions will vary at different points based on whether you are enrolled in SOC 4015 or SOC 5050. Look for this indiactor for information about *who* the vignette is designed for:

<div class="rmdpersonnel">
<p><strong>Personnel:</strong> This vignette should be completed by <strong>all</strong> students.</p>
</div>

If the instructions are only for one of the sections, they will look like this:

<div class="rmdpersonnel">
<p><strong>Personnel:</strong> This vignette should be completed by students in <strong>SOC 5050</strong> only.</p>
</div>

#### What order do I have to do the vignettes in? {-}
Some of the vignettes can be worked on in parallel while others require that a prior vignette has been completed. If there is a pre-requisite vignette that must be completed first, this indiactor will include pertinent details about ordering:

<div class="rmdpre">
<p><strong>Pre-requisties:</strong> This vignette should be completed <em>after</em> Vignette 6.</p>
</div>

Otherwise you will see this indicator:

<div class="rmdpre">
<p><strong>Pre-requisties:</strong> There are no pre-requisites for this vignette.</p>
</div>

#### What do I need to know how to do? {-}
Some of the vignettes require technical skills that will be covered as the semester progresses. If that is the case, those lectures will be identified with this indiactor:

<div class="rmdskills">
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Lectures 1 and 2</p>
</div>

#### When are vignettes due? {-}
Some of the vignettes have hard due dates while others do not. For vignettes without a firm deadline, a *suggested* deadline will be provided for those of you who appreciate a bit more structure. Firm deadlines will be provided in an indicator at the top of each vignette that looks like this:

<div class="rmddue">
<p><strong>Required Due Date:</strong> This vignette must be completed by March 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
</div>

Suggested deadlines will look like this:

<div class="rmddue">
<p><strong><em>Suggested</em> Completion Date:</strong> This vignette should be completed by March 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
</div>

#### What do I have to submit? {-}
All of the vignettes require you to produce *something*. A quick description of the deliverables associated with the vignette will be included in this indicator:

<div class="rmddeliver">
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> A knit <code>.Rmd</code> notebook with the appropriate <code>.md</code> output that uses a literate programming approach to document your data cleaning efforts should be included in your final project repository.</p>
</div>
