## Analysis Development

Your draft presentation should be saved in your `docs/` folder. You may find it makes sense to create a sub-folder for your presentation slides - something like `docs/slides/` - since the notebooks and their output will create quite a few files. You can make a similar sub-folder (`docs/handout/`) for your presentation handout. For both, save both the editable source document in its native format as well as a `.pdf` rendering of the document.

### Presentation Tools
There are no strict guidelines other than you should use a presentation tool common in academia. This includes Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)" target="_blank">LaTeX Beamer</a>. LaTeX is a professional typesetting tool that is widely used in academia for publishing, and it can make work like writing a graduate thesis significantly easier. If you are interesting in using this as an opportunity to learn LaTeX, I have some resources I can share. I also recommending working with <a href="http://sharelatex.com" target="_blank">ShareLaTeX</a>, which would allow you to share your work with me in a way that I can easily provide help and feedback.

If you are interested in using R and RStudio for creating your slides, there are a number of options:

* <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format" target="_blank">`ioslides`</a>
* <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/slidy_presentation_format" target="_blank">`slidy`</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/yihui/xaringan" target="_blank">`xaringan`</a>

Of these, I think that `xaringan` is the best (though it is also the least documented). You can see what its output looks like on <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1" target="_blank">Yihui Xie's website</a>. More details about `ioslides` and `slidy` can be found in Yihui's book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html" target="_blank">R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</a>.

I use `xaringan` for some tasks, but presentations are one area where I do not privilege plain-text documents - I teach and present research most often with Apple's Keynote.

As I said above, there are no strict requirements for presentation software other than that it be in wide use in academia. If a tool is not discussed in this section, please check with me before starting to build your presentation with it. The only tool that I do not allow students to use is Presi. Please choose the tool you feel either most comfortable with or that you see as a long term investment in skill building. 

### Handout Tools
As with presentation tools, I am not particularly concerned with the tool that you use to create your handout so long as it is in wide use in acadamia. Options include Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Adobe InDesign, LaTeX, or even RMarkdown. Most students will find Word or Pages to be the easiest choices, but I can provide some support to students who want to try their hand at using LaTeX or RMarkdown for the same task.

## Draft Presentation
Begin creating a draft that will evolve into a short, five to six minute presentation of your findings. Please refer to my resources on <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/presentingData/" target="_blank">presenting research</a> for guidance on constructing a good presentation. 

At the draft stage, you should already have identified a theme that you will use for your final presentation. The slides you submit should therefore be indicative of how your plan to visually design your final slides.

At the draft stage, presentations should include _as a minimum_:

1. A title slide (presentation title, name, date, etc.),
2. an agenda slide with the main topics you want to cover (see the "[Final Presentation](/final-presentation.html)" instructions for a full list of what should be included),
3. a literature slide 
    - SOC 4015 students should include the two or three key citations identified as part of the memo exercise
    - SOC 5050 students should avoid the temptation to summarize each of their sources; instead, synthesize the main points of the literature succinctly
4. a *draft* descriptive statistics table as described in the "[Initial Statistics](initial-statistics.html)",
5. and *draft* plots, including your histogram, q-q plot, and scatter plot described in the "[Exploratory Data Analysis](/exploratory-data-analysis.html)" section above.

Your draft will be graded using the "check" system outlined in the syllabus.

## Draft Handout
Using either a word processor (either Microsoft Word or Apple Pages), RMarkdown, or LaTeX, produce a handout that is clearly laid out and simple to follow. At the draft stage, you should have already identified the organizational strategy you will use for your handout. The handout you submit should therefore be indicative of how you plan to lay out your handout. 

At the draft stage, presentations should include _as a minimum_:

1. A title block that contains your title slide information (presentation title, name, date, etc.),
2. an abstract that summarizes your research question and hypothesis,
3. a descriptive statistics table, and
4. a few key citations.

These four elements should fit on the front size of an 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper.

Your draft will be graded using the "check" system outlined in the syllabus.
