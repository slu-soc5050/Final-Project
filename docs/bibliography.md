## What is an Annotated Bibliography?
An **Annotated Bibliography** is one approach for documenting your research on a topic. It should be constructed using a thorough, systematic **literature search** of the [peer reviewed](https://library.sdsu.edu/research-services/research-help/peer-reviewed-articles) literature on your topic. We are interested primarily in the peer reviewed literature because we we want to understand the scholarly debate that has unfolded about our topic. The peer review process is also one indicator of quality. 

### Peer Reviewed Sources

We typically think of peer review as falling into two categories - books and journal articles. While the process for reviewing books is different from articles, academic books are typically sent out for review before they are published by the publisher. Peer reviewed books are typically published by either a university press (e.g. Oxford University Press or The University of California Press) or by a publishing house that specializes in academic content (e.g. John Wiley & Sons).

Journal articles that are peer reviewed will be published in an academic journal. There are <a href="https://gmusocgrads.wordpress.com/development/journals/" target="_blank">many journals that publish sociological content</a>, along with others that publish more broadly in the social sciences (*Social Science & Medicine* is a great example). Beaware that not all journals are created equal - there is a whole group of so-called "predatory" journals (along with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/upshot/fake-academe-looking-much-like-the-real-thing.html" target="_blank">fake conferences</a>) that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/science/predatory-journals-academics.html" target="_blank">capitalize on the "publish or perish" culture of academia</a> as well as the relative isolation of many scholars in developing countries. While there are some lists of "predatory" journals, <a href="https://www.authoraid.info/en/news/details/1310/" target="_blank">learning how to evaluate *all* articles critically</a> is perhaps the best way to protect yourself against citing poor research.

### General Structure of Annotated Bibliography

The annotated bibilography itself is a document that lists your sources in alphabetical order (or alphabetized within groupings for specific categories). Begin each entry with a full, properly formatted citation using the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/formatting_in_sociology_asa_style/references_page_formatting.html" target="_blank">American Sociological Association (ASA) citation style</a>. 

I often get questions about whether students can use alternate citation formats. Different journals use different formats, so it is not possible for academics to learn and become comfortable with *just one* citation style. Rather, we use multiple citation styles regularly. Often, an article manuscript will be written in a specific citation style for one journal only to have to be reformatted in a different style for another journal if it is rejected on the first submission. Learning new citation styles quickly is therefore an important lesson, and one reason why ASA is the only citation style I accept for this project.

After the citation style, there should be one to two paragraphs summarizing the article and its importance for your project. The storngest annotated bibliographies will draw substantive or thematic connections betwene sources, noting which articles are cited by others and which articles share important connections. This will help you develop the synthesis your literature review section for the paper requires.

## Conducting the Literature Search


## Evaluating Sources
First, make sure what you've found is "[Peer Reviewed]". If you've found a report or a popular press article (something like Time Magazine), hang onto it if you think it provides helpful contextual background but it should not be part of your literature search. If you've identified a dissertation or a thesis that seems helpful, there are typically two things worth doing: (1) check to see if it has been published as an article or a book (sometimes you'll have to check out the author's CV if you can find it), and (2) use it to identify other peer reviewed materials.

<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_blank">Science Magazine</a> has a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper" target="_blank">great article</a> that describes how different academics read articles. If you look through their responses, you'll notice that few take a new article, read the abstract than read through the article cover to cover. Instead there are a variety of approaches to finding out the "meat" of the article quickly, without reading it in its entirety. Use this as a strategy for figuring out whether or not an article is a good fit for your project. Read the abstract, introduction, and discussion sections to get a sense of the paper. Ask yourself if it makes a contribution to what you are researching. If it does, add it to your spreadsheet and fill out the necessary details. If it _does not_, add it to the "discard" list so you can find it later if you change your mind (or if you forget whether you've read it or not!).
